.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Simple GUI tool to configure bluetooth adapter connectivity
for systemd and bluez (libbluetooth).

When run by a normal user (restricted mode), the functionality
is limited.

With Wayland it should be run with 'pkexec bluetoother'.
With X11 it is also possible to use 'sudo bluetoother'.

\fITroubleshooting\fR: If the 'pkexec' command doesn't work, it's
probably because there isn't a policykit authentication agent installed.
Each desktop environment usually has its own implementation, which
should be chosen.

At the time of writing, on \fBDebian\fR based distributions:
     - \fIMate\fR needs package 'mate-polkit' to be installed.
     - \fIXFCE\fR and \fICinnamon\fR need 'policykit-1-gnome'.
     - \fIKDE\fR needs 'polkit-kde-agent-1'.
     - \fILXDE\fR needs package 'lxpolkit'.

On \fBArch\fR based distributions the package names change slightly:
     - \fIMate\fR needs package 'mate-polkit'.
     - \fIXFCE\fR and \fICinnamon\fR need 'policy-gnome'.
     - \fIKDE\fR needs 'polkit-kde-agent'.
     - \fILXDE\fR needs package 'lxsession'.
