Requirements
------------
g++ compiler or compatible (>= C++14)
libgtkmm-3.0-dev
libbluetooth-dev

At runtime bluetoother needs the pkexec command (usually installed
by the policikit-1 package) to be started.
In order to work the Linux distro must support systemd and rfkill.


Instructions
------------

From this directory execute the following commands:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

  $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  ..

Instead of 'Release' CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE can also be set to
   'Debug', 'MinSizeRel' or 'RelWithDebInfo'.
To change the default installation directory add definition
   '-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local'  to the preceding command.

  $ make

  $ sudo make install



Alternatively you can just execute the script

  $ ./scripts/install_bluetoother.py  -b Release  --destdir /usr

setting the parameter(s) to your preferred value (like above).

  $ ./scripts/install_bluetoother.py  --help

for a description of all available options.
